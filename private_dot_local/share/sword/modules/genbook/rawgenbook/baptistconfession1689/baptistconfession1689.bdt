<title>FOREWORD</title>
<p>‘I have thought it right to reprint in a cheap form this excellent list of doctrines, which were subscribed to by the Baptist Ministers in the year 1689. We need a banner because of the truth; it may be that this small volume may aid the cause of the glorious gospel by testifying plainly what are its leading doctrines . . . May the Lord soon restore unto His Zion a pure language, and may her watchmen see eye to eye.’ So wrote the young C.H. Spurgeon, then in the second year of his ministry at New Park Street Chapel, Southwark, in a preface addressed to All the Household of Faith, who rejoice in the glorious doctrines of Free Grace with which he prefixed this Confession when he published it in October, 1855.
<p>The Confession itself was first compiled by the Elders and Brethren of many congregations of Christians, baptized upon their profession of faith, in London and the country (as they then described themselves) in the year 1677. It was based upon, and drew its inspiration from the Confession drawn up by the Westminster Assembly of Divines a generation earlier, and indeed differs only from it in its teaching upon those matters, such as baptism, the Lord's Supper, and church government, upon which among the Reformed churches the Baptists differ from the Presbyterians. For fear of persecution, the compilers of the 1677 Confession did not subscribe their names to it, but when, in September, 1689, following the Revolution of the previous year, the Ministers and Messengers of the churches were able to meet in more peaceful times, thirty-seven of them, including all the most eminent Baptist ministers of the day, set their names to the recommendation with which it was circulated among the churches. Thereafter for between 150 and 200 years it remained the definitive Confession of Faith of the Particular (or Calvinistic) Baptist churches of england and Wales.
<p>Mr. Spurgeon did not, however, when he republished this Confession, merely preface it with certain words of general commendation. He also addressed to his own church at New Park Street some practical words of advice as to how they should use the Confession. These are still relevant today.
<p>‘This little volume,’ he wrote, ‘is not issued as an authoritative rule, or code of faith, whereby you are to be fettered, but as an assistance to you in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in righteousness. Here the younger members of our church will have a body of divinity in small compass, and by means of the scriptural proofs, will be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in them.
<p>Be not ashamed of your faith; remember it is the ancient gospel of the martyrs, confessors, reformers, and saints. Above all, it is the truth of God, against which all the gates of Hell cannot prevail. Let your lives adorn your faith, let your example adorn your creed. Above all live in Christ Jesus, and walk in Him, giving credence to no teaching but that which is manifestly approved of Him, and owned by the Holy Spirit. Cleave fast to the Word of God which is here mapped out for you.’ This new edition of the Confession is sent out as a private venture by a small group of Baptists who are convinced that it has a message for this generation and believe its publication to be long overdue. They hope it will achieve a wide circulation among the churches, and receive the close study which they believe it will richly repay.
<p>In England during the 1630’s and the 1640’s Congregationalists and Baptists of Calvinistic persuasion emerged from the Church of England. Their early existence was marked by repeated cycles of persecution at the hands of the established religion of crown and Parliament. The infamous Clarendon Code was adopted in the 1660’s to crush all dissent from the official religion of the state. Periods of rigorous application and intervals of relaxation of these coercive acts haunted Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists alike.
<p>Presbyterians and Congregationalists suffered less than did Baptists under this harassment. No little reason for their relative success in resisting government tyranny was their united front of doctrinal agreement. All Presbyterians stood by their Westminster Confession of 1646. Congregationalists adopted virtually the same articles of faith in the Savoy Confession of 1658. Feeling their substantial unity with paedobaptists suffering under the same cruel injustice, Calvinistic Baptists met to publish their substantial harmony with them in doctrine.
<p>A circular letter was sent to particular Baptist churches in England and Wales asking each assembly to send representatives to a meeting in London in 1677. A confession consciously modeled after the Westminster Confession of Faith was approved and published. It has ever since born the name of the Second London Confession. The First London Confession had been issued by seven Baptist congregations of London in 1644. That first document had been drawn up to distinguish newly organized Calvinistic Baptists from the Arminian Baptists and the Anabaptists. Because this second London Confession was drawn up in dark hours of oppression, it was issued anonymously.
<p>A preface to the original publication of 1677 says in part: “. . . It is now many years since diverse of us . . . did conceive ourselves under a necessity of publishing a Confession of our Faith, for the information and satisfaction of those that did not thoroughly understand what our principles were, of had entertained prejudices against our profession . . . This was first put forth about the year 1643, in the name of seven congregations then gathered in London . . .” (These early Baptists were conscious that the 1644 Calvinistic Baptist Confession predated the 1646 Presbyterian Confession and the 1658 Congregationalist Confession).
<p>“Forasmuch as this confession is not now commonly to be had; and also that many others have since embraced the same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us to join together in giving a testimony to the world of our firm adhering to those wholesome principles . . .”

<p><title>Paragraph 2</title> In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himself by himself upon the cross, once for all;<note><reference osisRef="Heb.9.25">Heb. 9,25</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Heb.9.26">26</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Heb.9.28">28</reference></note> and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.11.24">1 Cor. 11,24</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.26.26">Matt. 26,26</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Matt.26.27">27</reference></note> So that the popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominable, injurious to Christ's own sacrifice the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect.</p>
<p><title>Paragraph 3</title> The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to give both to the communicants.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.11.23-1Cor.11.26">1 Cor. 11,23-26</reference>, etc.</note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 4</title> The denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of this ordinance, and to the institution of Christ.<note><reference osisRef="Matt.26.26-Matt.26.28">Matt. 26,26-28</reference>\. <reference osisRef="Matt.15.9">15,9</reference>\. <reference osisRef="Exod.20.4">Exod. 20,4</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Exod.20.5">5</reference></note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 5</title> The outward elements in this ordinance, duly set apart to the use ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, although in terms used figuratively, they are sometimes called by the names of the things they represent, in other words, the body and blood of Christ,<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.11.27">1 Cor. 11,27</reference></note> albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.11.26-1Cor.11.28">1 Cor. 11,26-28</reference></note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 6</title> That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood, commonly called transubstantiation, by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant not to Scripture alone,<note><reference osisRef="Acts.3.21">Acts 3,21</reference>; <reference osisRef="Luke.14.6">Luke 14,6</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Luke.15.4">39</reference></note> but even to common sense and reason, overthrows the nature of the ordinance, and has been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross idolatries.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.11.24">1 Cor. 11,24</reference>\.<reference osisRef="1Cor.11.25">25</reference></note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 7</title> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.10.16">1 Cor. 10,16</reference>\. <reference osisRef="1Cor.11.23-1Cor.11.26">11,23-26</reference></note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 8</title> All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table, and cannot, without great sin against him, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries, or be admitted thereunto;<note><reference osisRef="2Cor.6.14">2 Cor. 6,14</reference>\.<reference osisRef="2Cor.6.15">15</reference></note> yea, whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.11.29">1 Cor. 11,29</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.7.6">Matt. 7,6</reference></note></p>
<title>Chapter 31</title><title>OF THE STATE OF MAN AFTER DEATH, AND OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD</title>
<p><title>Paragraph 1</title> The bodies of men after death return to dust, and see corruption;<note><reference osisRef="Gen.3.19">Gen. 3,19</reference>; <reference osisRef="Acts.13.36">Acts 13,36</reference></note> but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them.<note><reference osisRef="Eccl.12.7">Eccles. 12,7</reference></note> The souls of the righteous being then made perfect in holiness, are received into paradise, where they are with Christ, and behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies;<note><reference osisRef="Luke.23.43">Luke 23,43</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.5.1">2 Cor. 5,1</reference>\.<reference osisRef="2Cor.5.6">6</reference>\.<reference osisRef="2Cor.5.8">8</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.1.23">Phil. 1,23</reference>; <reference osisRef="Heb.12.23">Heb. 12,23</reference></note> and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell; where they remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day;<note><reference osisRef="Rev.5.1-Rev.5.14">Jude 6</reference>\. <reference osisRef="Rev.7.1-Rev.7.17">7</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Pet.3.19">1 Peter 3,19</reference>; <reference osisRef="Luke.16.23">Luke 16,23</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Luke.16.24">24</reference></note> besides these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth none.</p>
<p><title>Paragraph 2</title> At the last day, such of the saints as are found alive, shall not sleep, but be changed;<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.15.51">1 Cor. 15,51</reference>\.<reference osisRef="1Cor.15.52">52</reference>; <reference osisRef="1Thess.4.17">1 Thess. 4,17</reference></note> and all the dead shall be raised up with the selfsame bodies, and none other;<note><reference osisRef="Job.19.26">Job 19,26</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Job.19.27">27</reference></note> although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their souls forever.<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.15.42">1 Cor. 15,42</reference>\.<reference osisRef="1Cor.15.43">43</reference></note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 3</title> The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour; the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious body.<note><reference osisRef="Acts.24.15">Acts 24,15</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.5.28">John 5,28</reference>\.<reference osisRef="John.5.29">29</reference>; <reference osisRef="Phil.3.21">Phil. 3,21</reference></note></p>
<title>Chapter 32</title><title>OF THE LAST JUDGMENT</title>
<p><title>Paragraph 1</title> God has appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness, by Jesus Christ;<note><reference osisRef="Acts.17.31">Acts 17,31</reference>; <reference osisRef="John.5.22">John 5,22</reference>\.<reference osisRef="John.5.27">27</reference></note> to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged,<note><reference osisRef="1Cor.6.3">1 Cor. 6,3</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rev.5.1-Rev.5.14">Jude 6</reference></note> but likewise all persons that have lived upon the earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<note><reference osisRef="2Cor.5.10">2 Cor. 5,10</reference>; <reference osisRef="Eccl.12.14">Eccles. 12,14</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.12.36">Matt. 12,36</reference>; <reference osisRef="Rom.14.10">Rom. 14,10</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Rom.14.12">12</reference>; <reference osisRef="Matt.25.32-Matt.25.46">Matt. 25,32-46</reference></note></p>


<p><title>Paragraph 2</title> The end of God's appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of his justice, in the eternal damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient;<note><reference osisRef="Rom.9.22">Rom. 9,22</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Rom.9.23">23</reference></note> for then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy and glory with everlasting rewards, in the presence of the Lord; but the wicked, who do not know God, and do not obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast aside into everlasting torments,<note><reference osisRef="Matt.25.21">Matt. 25,21</reference>\.<reference osisRef="Matt.25.34">34</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Tim.4.8">2 Tim. 4,8</reference></note> and punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.<note><reference osisRef="Matt.25.46">Matt. 25,46</reference>; <reference osisRef="Mark.9.48">Mark 9,48</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Thess.1.7-2Thess.1.10">2 Thess. 1,7-10</reference></note></p>
<p><title>Paragraph 3</title> As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin,<note><reference osisRef="2Cor.5.10">2 Cor. 5,10</reference>\.<reference osisRef="2Cor.5.11">11</reference></note> and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity,<note><reference osisRef="2Thess.1.5-2Thess.1.7">2 Thess. 1,5-7</reference></note> so will he have the day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come,<note><reference osisRef="Mark.13.35-Mark.13.37">Mark 13,35-37</reference>; <reference osisRef="Luke.12.35-Luke.12.40">Luke 12,35-40</reference></note> and may ever be prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus; come quickly.<note><reference osisRef="Rev.22.20">Rev. 22,20</reference></note> Amen.</p>
