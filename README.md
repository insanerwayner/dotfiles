# Wayne's Dotfiles

> **Minimal, modular, dynamic, and crafted for real daily workflows.**

---

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This dotfiles collection provides a **clean, resilient, and highly functional development and life management environment** for Linux systems.

Built to be:
- ðŸ§© **Modular** â€” small, composable, reusable components
- ðŸ›¡ **Resilient** â€” minimal system assumptions
- ðŸ›¸ **Dynamic** â€” adapts automatically to user tools and environment
- ðŸ§¹ **Minimal** â€” no unnecessary complexity
- ðŸš€ **Daily-Driver Ready** â€” tightly integrated with real-world workflows (task management, finance, development)

**Goal:**  
To create a lightweight, predictable environment that supports coding, task planning, personal finance, and window management without friction.

  - Clean, minimal shells ready for productivity

- **Graphical Environment**
  - **Hyprland** window manager
    - Configured for balanced tiling + floating
    - Integrated with `mako` for notifications
    - Custom Waybar configuration for status and control
    - Dynamic wallpapers and monitor management
    - Kitty terminal optimized for performance and aesthetics
  - Minimal dependencies (wayland-native apps preferred)

- **Task Management and Productivity**
  - **Taskwarrior** fully integrated for powerful CLI task management
  - Aliases and helpers to interact with Taskwarrior quickly
  - Designed for GTD-style workflows with minimal friction

- **Personal Finance**
  - **hledger** configured for personal ledger management
  - Simple financial tracking directly from the terminal
  - Fast, scriptable workflows for budget reviews and balance tracking

- **Editor Configuration**
  - **Neovim** configured minimally but powerfully
  - Smart defaults (sensible keybindings, clean UI)
  - Plugin architecture ready but lightweight
  - FZF integration for fuzzy file finding when available

- **Automation and Scripts**
  - Pre-apply script generates `.config/environment.d/99-env.conf`
  - Single `chezmoi apply` configures entire environment
